Task 2: Start a Packet Capture on an Ethernet Port and Save It to a File

2.1 Identifying the Ethernet Interface
Once Wireshark is installed and running, you’ll see a list of available network interfaces. The interface for the wired connection (Ethernet) typically starts with ‘en’ in its name (for example, enp0s3, eth0, etc.).

To start the packet capture:

Open Wireshark from your applications menu.
Select the appropriate Ethernet interface (e.g., enp0s3).
Click the Start button to begin capturing packets.
2.2 Stop and Save the Capture File
To stop the capture, click on the Stop button in Wireshark.
To save the capture:
Go to File > Save As.
Choose a location and save the capture with a .pcap or .pcapng file extension.
