Task 3: Use a Display Filter to Detect HTTPS Packets

3.1 Displaying HTTPS Traffic
You can use Wiresharkâ€™s display filters to focus on specific types of traffic, such as HTTPS (which uses TCP port 443).

To filter for HTTPS traffic:

In the Display Filter bar at the top of Wireshark, enter the following filter:

tcp.port == 443
This filter will display only packets that are being transmitted over TCP port 443, which is used for HTTPS.
